{"input":"I think this product would be amazing if you can get it to suction.  I could not.<br \/><br \/>My bathtub is very old and refinished in a ceramic-type finisher.  There is metal around the drain.  However, no matter how hard I tried, I could not get this to suction, which basically made it useless.  I also tried it in my kitchen sink, which is all metal.  It would not suction there either, so I tried to use it upside down.  Unfortunately, for kitchen sink use, the openings were too large to catch most of the debris I was trying to catch.<br \/><br \/>If you can get it to stick, I think you will like it.  However, I suspect it will not do this for most buyers (and it's so cheap and small, it's annoying to have to go through the motions to return it).  So, buyer beware.","rating":2,"answer":"negative"}
